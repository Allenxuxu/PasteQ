# [PasteQ](https://apps.apple.com/app/pasteq/id6443971843): A clipboard tool faster than Raycast's.

[中文](README_CN.md)｜English

Raycast is extremely practical, and I use it daily to search and open applications, as well as to start project code.

The built-in clipboard tool in Raycast is also useful, but it has some inconveniences:

* Raycast's clipboard history cannot easily and quickly perform daily operations. For example, filtering images, text, links, or viewing only the records of a specific group I have favorited. These operations cannot be directly switched after invoking Raycast, then viewed with arrow keys, or searched. Raycast requires multiple shortcut combinations to perform filtering.
* It is impossible to select multiple items and merge multiple records.  
* Data cannot be exported or backed up, nor is there multi-device synchronization. The records I favorite to a group or pin are relatively important or very commonly used. I hope to export backups and synchronize them across multiple devices.

## Core Features of PasteQ

* Floating window that can hover over any application.
* Can be invoked via shortcut keys and automatically hidden.
* Supports full operation using shortcut keys, including filtering record categories, searching, copying, and pasting.
* Shortcut keys do not need to be memorized deliberately. Each page's operable shortcut keys are displayed in the application's bottom prompt bar (users only need to remember one global shortcut key to invoke the application, which can also be customized).
* Does not seize focus and does not interrupt ongoing input (after invoking with shortcut keys, selecting a record can directly paste).
* Supports favorites, group management, and pinning functions (commonly used code snippets, screenshots, text, URLs, etc., can be favorited for quick use).
* Support multi-selecting records and merging them into one record for copying.
* Support re-editing of records.
* Supports data import and export, and can also perform iCloud synchronization.
* Focuses on privacy protection, all data is stored locally, and network calls are only made when previewing URLs (optional).
